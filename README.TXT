This is a top-down zombie themed shooting game I made in Greenfoot using Java. You can download the executable file here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B11MI7xcwGGWeDl0YmZDWjJOQmM?usp=sharing
Note: You need to have Java Runtime Environment installed. For better experience, Windows OS is suggested (unexpected behaviour can happen under MacOS).
